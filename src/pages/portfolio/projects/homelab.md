After 2 years of doing Smart Home related operations, I realized that the Raspberry Pi couldn't handle my operational needs anymore. That is when I started pivoting towards a homelab setup.

My Homelab currently consists of a NAS server running Proxmox. The underlying NAS software is TrueNAS with NFS shares configured for use by the other Virtual Machines in Proxmox.

The NAS server hosts various Quality of Life (QoL) applications for automations, storage, authentication, and monitoring. This includes automatic security patches, storing backups and photos, OAuth authentication, and the Prometheus/Grafana stack.

I am currently thinking of expanding my homelab's networking capabilities. From proper subnetting of networks to security ACLs for a more controlled and safe network infrastructure.
