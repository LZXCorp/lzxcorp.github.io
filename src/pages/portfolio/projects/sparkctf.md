**SparkCTF** is a **jeopardy-style** CTF competition, designed for Year 1 to Year 3 **Cybersecurity & Digtal Forensics students** to sharpen their skills and demonstrate their ability to quickly adapt and learn concepts within the time constraint of a regular CTF.

There is also an **Experiential Track** for newly matriculated Year 1's to kickstart their interest into Cybersecurity.

This CTF was initiated through the **Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Student Interest Group (CDFSIG)**.
