**SparkCTF** is a **jeopardy-style** CTF competition, designed for Year 1 to Year 3 **Cybersecurity & Digtal Forensics students** to sharpen their skills and demonstrate their ability to quickly adapt and learn concepts within the time constraint of a regular CTF.

There is also an **Experiential Track** for newly matriculated Year 1's to kickstart their interest into Cybersecurity.

This CTF was initiated through the **Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Student Interest Group (CDFSIG)**.

## Co-Organizers and Collaborators

**SparkCTF** wouldn't have existed if not for my fellow co-organizers that helped make this CTF into a reality!

## Challenges Experience when Hosting a CTF

There were several challenges that my team had to deal with to make this CTF possible.

1. **Creating Challenges**

    Our small team of 4 had to create over 60 challenges within a 2 month timeframe. We also did not have the resources to outsource challenge creation. This was eventually quickly solved thanks to our co-organizers for

2. **Infrastructure**

    Funnily enough, the infrastructure wasn't an issue. Rather, the cost of hosting the infrastructure was a concern for us. We eventually chose to use [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) since the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) gives $200 in platform credits, which is more than enough to host the whole infrastructure.

3. **Limited Staff**

    We were short-staffed with the support tickets. Thankfully, there were few to no support tickets that were opened during the competition.
